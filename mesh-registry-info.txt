ChunkedPlanetTerrain mesh registry notes

Required registries:
- _collisionMeshes (KNOWN): all terrain meshes created that are not disposed.
- _activeCollisionMeshes (ACTIVE): enabled + collision-enabled meshes that are within rcull/horizon/depth.

Relevant methods:
- _registerActiveTerrainMesh(mesh, node): ensures mesh.checkCollisions is true at creation/update, adds to known registry, and adds to active registry only when enabled.
- _tagColliderForTerrain(terrain, lodLevel): sets collision-enabled state and synchronizes the active registry for visible meshes.
- _setMeshCollisionActive(mesh, isActive): toggles mesh collision state and keeps active registry in sync.
- _unregisterActiveTerrainMesh(mesh): removes a mesh from the active registry (known registry retains it unless disposed).

Public APIs:
- getKnownCollisionMeshes(): returns the KNOWN registry filtered for non-disposed meshes.
- getActiveCollisionMeshes(): returns the ACTIVE registry filtered for enabled, collision-enabled, non-disposed meshes.
- getCollisionMeshes(): alias for active collision meshes used by physics.

Spawn readiness:
- Spawn checks should use getKnownCollisionMeshes() (fallback to collidable scene meshes only if registry is broken).
